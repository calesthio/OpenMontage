# Publish Director - Clip Factory Pipeline

## When To Use

This stage packages the clip batch into a distribution plan. The goal is not just exported files. The goal is a usable content engine.

## Prerequisites

| Layer | Resource | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Schema | `schemas/artifacts/publish_log.schema.json` | Artifact validation |
| Prior artifacts | `state.artifacts["compose"]["render_report"]`, `state.artifacts["idea"]["brief"]`, `state.artifacts["script"]["script"]` | Outputs, rankings, and goals |
| Playbook | Active style playbook | Brand voice |

## Process

### 1. Lead With The Strongest Clip

Do not schedule by chronology. Schedule by ranking.

The first published clip should usually be:

- the strongest hook,
- the cleanest standalone clip,
- the clip most aligned with the batch goal.

### 2. Tailor Copy By Platform

Each platform needs its own tone and packaging:

- TikTok / Reels: direct, fast, hook-led
- Shorts: searchable, keyword-aware
- LinkedIn: insight-led and more professional
- X: short, punchy, opinion-friendly

If a clip asks viewers to comment a word ("comment GUIDE for the checklist"), its TikTok / Reels copy in `platform_copy_map` must repeat that exact word in the first line, before the "more" cut. Record the CTA in `engagement_cta` (below). Don't add a CTA the clip doesn't have.

### 3. Package The Batch Cleanly

Group by platform and include ready-to-paste text assets, not just video files.

### 4. Preserve Batch Truth

Store in `publish_log.metadata`:

- `clip_catalog`
- `posting_order`
- `platform_copy_map`
- `schedule_notes`
- `engagement_cta` (only when a clip has a comment-keyword CTA): `keyword` (required), `promise`, `caption_line`, `dm_message` (a draft message that delivers the promise), `public_reply`, `platforms`. Nothing is sent from this stage. If the creator automates the DM with a comment-to-DM tool, list that as a follow-up in the approval summary.

### 5. Quality Gate

- strongest clips lead the rollout,
- captions are platform-specific,
- a comment-keyword CTA uses the same word on screen, in the caption and in `engagement_cta`,
- export folders are usable without extra cleanup,
- the batch catalog clearly links ranking, file paths, and publishing intent.

## Common Pitfalls

- Publishing the whole batch on the same day.
- Using one caption everywhere.
- Losing the rank/order logic after rendering is complete.

## Gate Reminder (Binding)

This stage gates on human approval (`human_approval_default: true`). After review passes:
checkpoint with `status="awaiting_human"`, present the summary (the Backlot board renders
the artifact), and **END YOUR TURN**. Do not start the next stage in the same response.
Approval is per-gate — an earlier "go ahead" does not cover this gate.
