# Asset Director - Character Animation Pipeline

## Goal

Produce `asset_manifest` with character parts, backgrounds, props, audio, music,
and preview artifacts.

## Layer 3 Gate

Before authoring or generating animation assets, read the relevant Layer 3 skills:

- `character-rigging`
- `svg-character-animation`
- `pose-library-design`
- `canvas-procedural-animation` when p5/canvas effects are used
- `character-animation-qa` before review
- `gsap-core`, `gsap-timeline`, and `gsap-react` for GSAP/Remotion work
- `remotion` and `remotion-best-practices` for Remotion render work
- `hyperframes` and `hyperframes-cli` for HyperFrames work

Before image/TTS/music generation, read the tool's `agent_skills` from the
registry.

## Asset Organization

Write character assets under:

```text
projects/<project-name>/assets/characters/<character-id>/
```

Use subfolders:

```text
parts/
poses/
previews/
```

Generated backgrounds go under:

```text
projects/<project-name>/assets/backgrounds/
```

## Process

1. Produce or source only the parts required by `rig_plan`.
2. Keep each moving part separate.
3. Preserve transparent backgrounds for parts.
4. Record prompts, seeds, providers, and model names.
5. Build a small preview before full asset expansion.

## Quality Bar

All parts referenced by `rig_plan` must exist before compose. Missing parts are a
blocker unless the action timeline removes the action requiring them.
